            Breath leaves your body or mine.I love how you hold me. I love how you tell me l'm beautiful. I love how you
            look at me funny when I say something stupid. I love how you make me happy. I love how you smile when I see
            you. I love how you laugh when I say something random, or stupid. I love the face you make when I snort when
            I laugh. I love how you ask me if l'm alright when I cant stop laughing. I love how you make me feel. I love
            how you tell me l look cute. I love how you like my pajamas. I love how you talk about music for hours. I
            love how you say sweet things to me. I love how you whisper in my ear when it's really quiet. I love how you
            squeeze me so hard when I hug you. I love how I can talk to you for hours about anything, and you listen,
            and I listen. I love how we call each other as soon as we wake up. I love how you sound when I wake you up.
            I love how you want to spend every day with me. I love how you squeeze my hand. I love how you rub my back,
            and kiss my neck. I love how you lay next to me, and tell me that everything's perfect. I love how
            everything is perfect. I love how you see the person I really am. I love how you say we are perfect for each
            other. I love how you make me cry, but not because l'm upset or sad, or you hurt me, but because you made me
            the happiest person ever. I love how I wake up in the morning for you. I love how you kiss me. I love how I
            look at the empty space in my bed, and wish you were filling it. I love how I get nervous when I see you,
            but feel more comfortable with you than I do with anyone else. I love how you deal with my picky habits. I
            love how you worry about me, and take care of me. I love how you pay for me when we go places. I love how
            you insist everything will be alright, and make me feel at ease. I love how you keep me warm when l'm cold.
            I love how you give me weird looks at awkward moments. I love how you stop everything for me. I love how l'm
            important to you. I love how I make you happy. I love how you make me happy. I love how you make sure l stay
            in line. I love how I only want to be with you.</div>
