                    you're my favourite person to miss, to love, to be everything. You're my everything. I want to give
                    you everything I have. I want to share my life with you. I want to make memories with you, so I can
                    look back in 50 years and be sure I haven't missed out on anything because all I've wanted is you.I
                    will love you always. When this red hair is white, I will still love you. When the smooth softness
                    of youth is replaced by the delicate softness of age, I will still want to touch your skin. When
                    your face is full of the lines of every smile you have ever smiled, of every surprise I have seen
                    flash through your eyes, when every tear you have ever cried has left its mark upon your face,I will
                    treasure you all the more, because I was there to see it all. <a href="forever-us.html" style="text-decoration: none; display: flex; justify-content: center;"><button

            <p class="footer-content">Happy 21 years of existance to my favourite human. I am so proud of the person you
                are and how passionate you are about growing into the better version of yoyself everday you inspire me
                everday. Thankyou for being born and making life feel so effortless and easy and i love living this
                crazy life with You .I love you 3000 When I was little, I thought love was about red roses and expensive
                dinners. Truth is, love is giving her half your fries when she said she wasn‚Äôt hungry. It‚Äôs waking up at
                4 am to her snoring and refraining from shoving her off the bed. It‚Äôs talking in accents just for shits
                and trying to embarrass one another in public. It‚Äôs going on adventures and making fun of each other.
                It‚Äôs stupid fights and memorable makeups. Love isn‚Äôt pretty and romantic. Love is just stumbling through
                life with your best friend.You make the small moment special. Life is not going to be full of heart
                throbbing thrills and non-stop adventure, but when it slows down, I'll know I can sit with you, talk
                with you, or hold you in my hands, and still feel like I'm going 1000 miles an hour I really enjoy
                spending time with you, even if we're just going to be sitting around and talking about nothing. there
                are a million things i love about you, like your nose or the way you smile, the way you look me in the
                eyes, too. and i just get the greatest feeling when i make you laugh. i feel as if my company makes you
                happy, and that's what i wish for you. for you to be happy. and when i see you laugh at my clumsy ways,
                it just makes me want to spend the rest of my life with you so i can see a smile on your face.You're so
                easy to fall in love with, everything about you is so incredible. You have such an amazing soul and a
                heart that's made out of gold. You're my favorite person, and I'm so crazy in love with you. Life
                wouldn't have been the same if you hadn't walked through those doors that night. You became my safe
                place, you will always be my home. I Lovvvvveeeeee Youuuuuuuuuuuuu ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§.</p>
